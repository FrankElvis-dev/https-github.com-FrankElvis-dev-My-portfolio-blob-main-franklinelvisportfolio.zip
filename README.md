## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally or upload to GitHub, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Node.js (v16+) installed.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Development

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Build for Production

## 🎨 Features

- **Responsive Landing Page**: High-performance UI with smooth animations.
- **Client Dashboard Demo**: A fully functional mock dashboard showing charts and data visualization.
- **AI Agent Interface**: A conversational sidebar simulating an AI assistant.
- **Dark Mode**: Fully supported system-aware dark mode.

## 📝 Configuration Note

This project uses Tailwind CSS via a CDN script in `index.html` for instant portability and runtime configuration. For a production environment involving large scale, you may consider migrating to a PostCSS build process, though the current setup is fully functional and highly performant for a portfolio site.
